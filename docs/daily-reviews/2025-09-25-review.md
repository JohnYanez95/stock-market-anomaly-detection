## üîç Key Strategic Insights

### AWS Setup Success
**Technical Foundation**:
- AWS CLI installed and functional via pip after WSL sudo limitations
- Custom IAM policy designed with specific EC2 instance type restrictions
- Security-first approach with programmatic access and minimal permissions
- Ready for immediate IAM user creation and CLI configuration next session

### IAM Security Architecture Excellence
**Professional Security Design**:
```json
{
    "PolicyName": "CryptoStreamingProjectPolicy",
    "Permissions": [
        "ec2:RunInstances (t2.micro/t3.micro only)",
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:CreateSecurityGroup", 
        "iam:GetUser",
        "sts:GetCallerIdentity"
    ],
    "AccessType": "Programmatic only (no console)"
}
```

### Exceptional Scope Management
**Strategic Decision-Making**:
- **Recognized complexity creep**: Docker + TimescaleDB + Supervisor = too much at once
- **Clean pivot execution**: Removed all Docker files without hesitation
- **Focused learning**: Prioritized AWS fundamentals over advanced deployment
- **Professional discipline**: Chose strategic patience over implementation rush

## üí° Problem-Solving Excellence

### WSL Environment Adaptation
**Challenge**: `sudo` permissions not available, `unzip` command missing
**Solution**: Used `pip install awscli` instead of official installer
**Result**: AWS CLI v1.42.39 functional and ready for use

### IAM Policy Design
**Challenge**: Balance security with functionality for crypto streaming project
**Solution**: Custom policy with EC2 instance type restrictions and minimal permissions
**Result**: Secure, cost-controlled access ready for implementation

### Complexity Management
**Challenge**: Docker containerization attempt became overwhelming
**Solution**: Strategic pivot to AWS basics with clean file removal
**Result**: Focused learning path with clear next session objectives
