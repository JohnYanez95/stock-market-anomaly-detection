## 🔍 Key Technical Insights Discovered

### Data Fields Deep Dive

**OHLC Prices (per minute):**
- **Open**: First trade price in that minute
- **High**: Highest trade price in that minute  
- **Low**: Lowest trade price in that minute
- **Close**: Last trade price in that minute

**Volume vs Transactions:**
- **Volume**: Total shares traded (quantity)
- **Transactions**: Number of individual trades (frequency)
- **Insight**: Reveals market participant behavior (retail vs institutional)

**VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price):**
```
VWAP = Σ(Price × Volume) / Σ(Volume)
```
- More accurate than simple average
- Weights each trade by its volume
- Shows where money actually changed hands
- **Key insight**: Applicable to any time-series with intensity weighting

### Volatility Analysis

**Calculation Method:**
1. Calculate minute-to-minute returns: `(price_now - price_prev) / price_prev`
2. Take standard deviation of returns
3. Annualize: `minute_vol × √390 × √252`

**Results:**
- **TSLA**: 48.23% (unusually high for large cap)
- **GOOGL**: 19.69% (moderate)
- **AAPL**: 15.95% (stable blue-chip)
- **MSFT**: 17.89% (stable enterprise)
- **VOO**: 7.36% (very stable ETF)

**Historical Volatility Usage:**
- Typical lookback: 30-90 days for operational monitoring
- Rolling windows adapt to changing market regimes
- Used as baseline for anomaly detection thresholds

### Market Patterns Identified

**Trading Hours Distribution:**
- Pre-market (3-9 AM): High activity
- Regular hours (9:30 AM-4 PM): Peak activity
- After-hours: Limited in our dataset

**Volume Anomalies Detected:**
- **TSLA**: 95 volume spikes (>3σ)
- **GOOGL**: 59 spikes
- **AAPL**: 53 spikes
- **MSFT**: 33 spikes
- **VOO**: 14 spikes (ETF behavior)

**Cross-Asset Correlations:**
- **High price correlations** (0.8+): AAPL-TSLA (0.961)
- **Low return correlations** (<0.25): Good for anomaly cross-validation

## 💡 Conceptual Breakthroughs

### 1. Weighted Time-Series Analysis
**Discovery**: VWAP concept extends beyond finance
- **Traditional approach**: Median for central tendency
- **Weighted approach**: Context-aware importance weighting
- **Applications**: IoT sensors, system monitoring, quality control

**Example**: Device amperage monitoring
```
Traditional: Simple average of readings
Weighted: Duration-weighted average showing operational reality
Result: Better anomaly detection based on operational patterns
```

### 2. Market Microstructure Understanding
**Volume + Transactions reveal trading behavior:**
- High volume + Low transactions = Institutional blocks
- High volume + High transactions = Active mixed trading
- Low volume + High transactions = Retail/algorithmic activity
- Low volume + Low transactions = Quiet periods

### 3. Multi-Timeframe Volatility
**Historical volatility considerations:**
- Short-term (30-60 days): Responsive to recent changes
- Medium-term (90 days): Balanced approach
- Long-term (1 year): Stable baseline
- **Best practice**: Use ensemble of multiple timeframes

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Limits Understanding
**Polygon.io Free Tier:**
- **REST API**: 5 calls/minute, 10,000 calls/month
- **WebSocket**: Unlimited volume, 15-minute delayed
- **Data access**: Up to 50,000 records per call
- **Historical**: 2 years of data available

**Strategic implications:**
- Historical collection: Very feasible (5 calls used of 10,000)
- Real-time streaming: WebSocket bypasses API limits
- 15-minute delay acceptable for anomaly detection

### Data Quality Assessment
**Issues identified:**
- Time gaps during market closures (expected)
- No missing values in dataset
- All OHLC consistency checks passed
- Volume spike patterns detected correctly

## 🎯 Key Questions Resolved

1. **"What's the VWAP formula?"** → Volume-weighted pricing that reflects actual trading
2. **"Volume vs Transactions?"** → Quantity vs frequency of trading activity  
3. **"How is volatility calculated?"** → Standard deviation of returns, annualized
4. **"What's historical volatility?"** → Past behavior baseline for anomaly detection
5. **"API access limits?"** → Call-based limits, WebSocket streaming available
6. **"Weighted vs median analysis?"** → Context-aware vs position-based measurement
