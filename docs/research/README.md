## 🎯 Key Findings Summary

### Market Data Discovery
Based on our 30-second test capturing 845 messages:

#### **Available Data Streams**:
- ✅ **XT (Trades)**: Individual transactions with condition codes [1], [2]
- ✅ **XQ (Quotes)**: Real-time bid/ask prices and spreads  
- ✅ **XA (Aggregates)**: Minute OHLC bars (current system)

#### **Trade Condition Analysis**:
- **Condition [1]**: Likely "market buy" orders (buyer initiated)
- **Condition [2]**: Likely "market sell" orders (seller initiated)
- **Pattern evidence**: Consistent pricing for [1], varied for [2]

#### **Quote Analysis**:
- **Spread range**: $0.8 to $13+ (liquidity indicator)  
- **Update frequency**: Multiple per second (high-resolution order book)
- **Market stress correlation**: Wide spreads during volatility

### Strategic Recommendations

#### **Immediate Implementation** (Phase 1-2):
1. **Extend database schema** with buy/sell fields
2. **Implement minute-level aggregation** from XT/XQ data
3. **Add buy/sell pressure indicators** to dashboard
4. **Replace XA dependency** with our own calculations

#### **Advanced Development** (Phase 3-4):
1. **Order flow imbalance** calculations
2. **Liquidity analysis** from spread data
3. **Enhanced anomaly detection** using microstructure
4. **Real-time trading signals** from buy/sell pressure

## 🔬 Research Methodology

### Data Collection Approach
1. **Empirical observation**: Captured live market data samples
