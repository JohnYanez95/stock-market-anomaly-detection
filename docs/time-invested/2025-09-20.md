## Key Technical Discussions

### Storage Architecture Tradeoffs
**SQLite vs TimescaleDB Analysis**:
- **SQLite Pros**: Simple, no external dependencies, perfect for development
- **SQLite Cons**: Limited concurrent writes, no advanced time-series features
- **TimescaleDB Pros**: Hypertables, advanced time-series functions, PostgreSQL ecosystem
- **TimescaleDB Cons**: Additional infrastructure, PostgreSQL setup complexity
- **Decision**: Start with SQLite, migrate when dashboard performance requires it

### Storage Debt Calculations
**Annual Storage Requirements**:
- **Market data**: ~470 MB/year for continuous multi-asset streaming
- **Anomaly data**: ~50 MB/year for detected events
- **Total projected**: ~520 MB/year
- **Available capacity**: 1.52 TB remaining on 2TB drive
- **Conclusion**: Storage debt minimal, ~2,900 years capacity at current rates

### Real-Time Labeling System Design
**User-Defined Event Marking**:
- **Click-to-mark boundaries**: Visual anomaly event start/end points
- **Classification dropdowns**: Event type categorization (volume_spike, price_break, etc.)
- **Supervised learning pipeline**: Human-labeled events become training data
- **Database schema ready**: start_time, end_time, status fields prepared

    asset_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    price REAL NOT NULL,
    volume REAL NOT NULL,
    -- Optimized indexes for dashboard queries
    INDEX(symbol, timestamp),

CREATE TABLE anomalies (
    start_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
    end_time DATETIME,          -- For future user labeling
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
    anomaly_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    multiplier REAL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'detected'  -- detected, confirmed, labeled
