---

## Progress Against Roadmap

### Phase 4 AWS Infrastructure - INITIATED ✅
- **AWS Account**: ✅ Free tier account created and verified
- **CLI Installation**: ✅ AWS CLI v1.42.39 installed via pip
- **IAM Planning**: ✅ Security architecture designed
- **Next Session Ready**: ✅ Clear IAM user creation steps defined

### Strategic Course Correction
- **Complexity Management**: Recognized Docker containerization was premature
- **Focus Refinement**: Prioritized AWS fundamentals over advanced deployment
- **Learning Approach**: Chose hands-on AWS exploration over theoretical implementation

---

## Session Effectiveness Rating

### Focus & Strategic Thinking
- **Initial direction**: 8/10 (good AWS CLI installation approach)
- **Mid-session pivot**: 10/10 (excellent recognition of scope creep)
- **Strategic decision-making**: 10/10 (prioritized learning over premature implementation)

### Technical Problem Solving
- **WSL adaptation**: 9/10 (pip installation after sudo limitations)
- **IAM design**: 9/10 (comprehensive security planning with least privilege)
- **Scope management**: 10/10 (clean file removal and refocus)

---

## Key Strategic Insights

### AWS Learning Approach
**Progressive Complexity**:
- Start with basic IAM user creation and CLI configuration
- Move to simple EC2 instance deployment
- Add Docker containerization only after AWS fundamentals solid

### Security Architecture Excellence
**IAM Best Practices Applied**:
- Custom policy with specific EC2 instance type restrictions
- Programmatic access only for service accounts
- MFA planning for enhanced security

### Scope Management Success
**Complexity Recognition**:
- Docker, TimescaleDB, supervisor, health checks = too much at once
- AWS basics (IAM, EC2) = appropriate next step
- Clean file removal shows good discipline

---

## Next Session Preparation

### Immediate Priority: IAM User Creation (15 minutes)
- [ ] Create crypto-streaming-user in AWS console
- [ ] Create and attach CryptoStreamingProjectPolicy
- [ ] Generate and securely store access keys
- [ ] Configure AWS CLI with new credentials

### AWS CLI Testing (10 minutes)
- [ ] Test connection: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
- [ ] Verify permissions: `aws ec2 describe-instances`
- [ ] Explore available EC2 options: `aws ec2 describe-images`

### EC2 Exploration (15-20 minutes)
- [ ] Research t2.micro vs t3.micro options
- [ ] Understand security groups basics
- [ ] Plan first instance launch strategy
